This is a list of the database related things (nouns) that Hither cares about.

- Databases

  The Database implementations we work with:

  * PostgreSQL
  * MySQL
  * SQLite

- Codebases

  A software codebase/repo expects a database to be in a given state/schema.
  Hither gives the state an ID, that should be put into the codebase. The
  application can check the state when connecting.

- SQL Schema Files

- SQL Data Dumps

- SQL Migration Files

- Hither Data Fixture Files

  - Database content in a YAML (or CSV) file

- CSV Files

  Hither can produce schemas and fixtures from datasets that are stored as CSV.
  This is useful for testing and playing with Hither. There are a ton of CSV
  datasets on the Internet.

- ORM Schema Classes

  * DBIx::Class
  * Django model classes
  * Rails model classes

- Hither Schema Definition (HSD) Files

  A YAML file that contains all the info to generate an SQL schema or ORM
  class. Each database has an HSD file that defines its current state.

- Hither State ID

  This is the (probably) the SHA1 of a HSD file's content. It provides a
  single, definitive name for the schema state that a database is currently in.
  This value is kept in the database's "hither" table. It is also kept in the
  codebase(s) that use the database (declaring the state that the code revision
  expects the database to be in).

- Hither State Table

  The database has a table called "hither" that contains a history of the
  states and migrations between them.

- Hither Migration File

  A YAML file that contains all the info needed to perform a migration from one
  state to another.
